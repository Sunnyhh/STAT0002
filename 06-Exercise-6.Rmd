# Exercise 6

## Question 1 
A machine makes components whose lengths must be between the specification limits of 6.45cm and 6.55cm. Let L denote the length of a randomly chosen componet made by the machine. Suppose that L has a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

Based on measurements of a very large number of components it is found that $5\%$ of components are longer than 6.55cm and $5\%$ of components are shorter than 6.45cm.

**(a)** Find $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$
$$P(X > 6.55) = 1 - \Phi(\frac{6.55 - \mu}{\sigma}) = 0.05$$
$$P(X < 6.45) = \Phi(\frac{6.45 - \mu}{\sigma}) = 0.05$$
By inspecting the Normal Distribution Function table,
$$z = \frac{6.55 - \mu}{\sigma} = 1.6449$$
$$\therefore \mu = 6.55 - 1.6449 \sigma$$
Substitute this relationship into the second equation,
$$\frac{6.45 - (6.55 - 1.6449 \sigma)}{\sigma} = -1.6449$$
$$2 * 1.6449 \sigma = 0.1$$
$$\sigma = 0.0304$$
$$\therefore \mu = 6.5, \sigma^2 = 0.001$$

**(b)** Consider the next 100 components made by the machine. What is the distribution of the number of these components that have a length between the specification limits? State any extra assumptions that you make.

Let X denote the length of the component made by the machine, $X \sim B(100, 0.9)$. The number of these components that have a length between the specification limits is follows a binomial distribution considering it satisfies the following requirements: 

* The total number of observations is fixed at 100 components.
* Each observation is independent and has 2 outcomes - $X$ falls in the specification limits or not.
* The probability of the length of each component falling in the specification range is fixed at $0.9$.

## Question 2
Suppose that $U$ is uniformly distributed over $(0,1)$, i.e. $U \sim U(0,1)$. Let $X = -\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln{U}$, where $\lambda > 0$.

**(a)** Find the c.d.f $F_x(x) = P(X \leq x)$ of X.
$$\begin{align}
  F_x(x) &= P(X \leq x) \\ 
  &= P(-\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln{U} \leq x) \\
         &= P(U \geq e^{-\lambda x}) \\
         &= 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
\end{align}$$

**(b)** Find the p.d.f $f_x(x)$ of X.
$$\begin{align}
  f_x(x) &= \frac{d}{dx} (F_x(x)) \\
         &= \frac{d}{dx} (1 - e^{-\lambda x}) \\
         &= \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
\end{align}$$

**(c)** Name the distribution of X.
<center>
  $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$ <br>
  The random variable X follows an Exponential Distribution. 
</center>

**(d)** Find the mean, median, and mode of X. 
  $$Mean = \mathbb{E}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$ 
  $$Median = \mathbb{m}[X] = \frac{\ln{2}}{\lambda}$$
  $$Mode = 0$$
