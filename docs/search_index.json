[["fun-fact.html", "Week 7 Fun Fact", " Week 7 Fun Fact A fun fact introduced by Dr.Â Soo during the departmental social event: Given that \\(U_1, U_2, U_3...\\) are independent and identically distributed where \\(U_i \\sim \\text{unif}[0,1]\\). Let \\(T = \\textbf{min}\\{n \\leq 1: U_1 + U_2 + ... + U_n &gt; 1\\}\\), where \\(n = 2, 3, 4..., etc\\). The expected value of \\(T\\) approximately equals to \\(e\\), i.e., \\(\\mathbb{E}(T) \\approx e\\). We can prove this statement by running an R simulation: T &lt;- function() { n = 0 t = 0 while (t &lt; 1) { t &lt;- t + runif(1) n &lt;- n + 1 } n } Expected_Value = mean(replicate(100000, T())) ## E(T) = 2.71966 "]]
