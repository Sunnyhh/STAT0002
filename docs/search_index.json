Calculate the five-number summary of these data. library(stat0002) # To give us a better understanding of the data imported: sort(days) ## [1] 31 199 491 881 895 967 989 1036 1260 1418 1427 1460 1460 1460 1460 ## [16] 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1461 1461 1461 1503 1655 1886 2027 ## [31] 2039 2727 2810 2864 2921 2921 2921 2921 2921 2921 2922 2922 2922 2922 2922 ## [46] 4422 fivenum(days) ## [1] 31.0 1460.0 1460.5 2921.0 4422.0 Therefore, the five-number summary of the dataset is (31, 1460, 1460.5, 2921, 4422) days. 1.2 Question 2 Create a boxplot of these data. boxplot(days, horizontal = T, xlab = &quot;Mystery Variable (Days)&quot;) Combining the shape of this boxplot and the data summary we acquired above, the shape of the distribution of this dataset is slightly positively skewed. There are no outliers. All the data values are concluded in the boxplot. The boxplot visualizes the five-number summary as well as the location, shape, and spread of the distribution. 1.3 Question 3 Create histograms of these data with with different breaks. hist(days, breaks = c(0, 500, 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500), freq = F) hist(days, breaks = c(0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500), freq = F) While the first histogram shows us a rough shape and distribution, the second histogram is more detailed with more breaks. We can easily identify the modes of distribution using histograms and acquire a basic shape of the distribution as well. 1.4 Question 4 Create a stem-and-leaf plot of the data. stem(days) ## ## The decimal point is 3 digit(s) to the right of the | ## ## 0 | 02 ## 0 | 599 ## 1 | 000344 ## 1 | 555555555555555579 ## 2 | 00 ## 2 | 78999999999999 ## 3 | ## 3 | ## 4 | 4 We could conclude from this plot that the shape of this dataset follows a bimodal distribution, where a lot of values in the data fall around 1500 and 2900. 1.5 Question 5 Create a dot plot of the data. stripchart(days, method = &quot;stack&quot;, at = 0, offset = 1, pch = 16, xlab = &quot;Mysterious Variable (Days)&quot;) The dot plot confirms our conclusion from the stem-and-leaf plot stated above. 1.6 Question 6 Find if there are any outliers in this dataset. IQR &lt;- IQR(days) UpperBound &lt;- 2921 + 1.5 * IQR LowerBound &lt;- 1460 - 1.5 * IQR UpperBound ## [1] 5091.125 LowerBound ## [1] -710.125 All the values from the data fall in the range \\(\\in [-710.125, 5091.125]\\). Therefore, there aren’t any outliers. Since 2922 days are approximately equivalent to 8 years, these data might represent the time it takes for people to get a Ph.D., the 8-year cycle of Venus, or the length of the presidency of the United States.

As a result, \\(y_{1/2} = ax_{1/2} + b\\). (c) Summary: The above results about sample mean and sample median are reasonable based on mathematical proof. 2.2 Question 2 - Spread (a) Standard Deviation \\[\\begin{aligned} S_x &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\ S_y &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} \\\\ S_y &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (ax_i + b - (a\\bar{x} + b))^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\ &amp;= a \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\ \\therefore S_y &amp;= a S_x \\end{aligned}\\] (b) Sample Interquartile Range \\[\\begin{aligned} q_U^x - q_L^x &amp;= x_{\\frac{3}{4}(n+1)} - x_{\\frac{1}{4}(n+1)} \\\\ q_U^y - q_L^y &amp;= y_{\\frac{3}{4}(n+1)} - y_{\\frac{1}{4}(n+1)} \\\\ q_U^y - q_L^y &amp;= ax_{\\frac{3}{4}(n+1)} + b - (ax_{\\frac{1}{4}(n+1)} + b) \\\\ q_U^y - q_L^y &amp;= a(x_{\\frac{3}{4}(n+1)} - x_{\\frac{1}{4}(n+1)}) \\\\ \\therefore q_U^y - q_L^y &amp;= a(q_U^x - q_L^x) \\end{aligned}\\] (c) Summary: The above results about sample interquartile range and standard deviation make sense based on mathematical proof. 2.3 Question 3 - Shape (a) Standardized Sample Skewnewss \\[\\require{cancel} \\begin{aligned} Skewness_x &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^3}{S_x^3} \\\\ Skewness_y &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^3}{S_y^3} \\\\ Skewness_y &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\cancel{a^3} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^3}{\\cancel{a^3} \\cdot S_x^3} \\\\ \\therefore Skewness_y &amp;= Skewness_x \\end{aligned}\\] (b) Sample Quartile Skewness \\[\\require{cancel} \\begin{aligned} Skewness_x &amp;= \\frac{(q_U^x - m_x) - (m_x - q_L^x)}{q_U^x - q_L^x} \\\\ Skewness_y &amp;= \\frac{(q_U^y - m_y) - (m_y - q_L^y)}{q_U^y - q_L^y} \\\\ Skewness_y &amp;= \\frac{\\cancel{a}((q_U^x - m_x) - (m_x - q_L^x))}{\\cancel{a}(q_U^x - q_L^x)} \\\\ \\therefore Skewness_y &amp;= Skewness_x \\end{aligned}\\] (c) Summary: The above results about standardized sample skewness and sample quartile skewness are correct based on mathematical proof. 2.4 Question 4 - About Sample Size Explain the reason why these summary statstics require \\(n \\geq 3\\). The precondition is \\(n \\geq 3\\) because when the sample size is too small, it’s meaningless to investigate summary statistics. There’s nothing to investigate about a set of variables with only one or two data. A smaller sample size also leads to increasing percentage uncertainty while calculating the data. Finally, \\(n \\neq 1\\) also because that the process of calculating standard deviation requires we use \\((n-1)\\) as a denominator, and 0 can’t be a denominator. "],["exercise-3.html", "Week 3 Exercise 3 3.1 Question 1 3.2 Question 2 3.3 Question 3", " Week 3 Exercise 3 Two fair dice, one red and one blue, are thrown. For each die: the possible scores are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Each score is equally likely, so each score has probability \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). You may assume that the score on red die is independent of the score on the blue die. We define the following events: \\(A\\): sum of the scores on the dice is 7. \\(B\\): the score on the red die is different from the score on the blue die. \\(C\\): the sum of the scores on the dice is 11. \\(D\\): the score on the red die is 6. 3.1 Question 1 (a) Calculate \\(P(A), P(B), P(C)\\), and \\(P(D)\\). \\[P(A) = (\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) \\cdot 6 = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ P(B) = \\frac{5}{6} \\\\ P(C) = (\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) \\cdot 2 = \\frac{1}{18} \\\\ P(D) = \\frac{1}{6}\\] (b) Calculate \\(P(A,B), P(A,C)\\), and \\(P(A,D)\\). \\[P(A,B) = P(A) = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ P(A,C) = 0 \\\\ P(A,D) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\] (c) Calculate \\(P(A or B), P(A or C)\\), and \\(P(A or D)\\). \\[P(A \\ or \\ B) = P(B) = \\frac{5}{6} \\\\ P(A \\ or \\ C) = P(A) + P(C) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{2}{9} \\\\ P(A \\ or \\ D) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{11}{36}\\] (d) Calculate \\(P(B \\mid A), P(C \\mid A)\\), and \\(P(D \\mid A)\\). \\[P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,B)}{P(A)} = 1 \\\\ P(C \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,C)}{P(A)} = 0 \\\\ P(D \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,D)}{P(A)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{36}}{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\] 3.2 Question 2 Which of the following pairs of events are independent and why? (a) A and B. \\(P(A,B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\neq P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\), \\(\\therefore A\\) is not independent of \\(B\\). Events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not independent if \\(A\\) happens (the sum of the scores on 2 dice equal 7), \\(B\\) must happen since the score on the red die must be different from the score on the blue one. (b) A and C. \\(P(A,C) = 0\\), \\(\\therefore A\\) is not independent of \\(C\\). Events A and C are not independent, they are mutually exclusive since these 2 events cannot happen at the same time. (c) A and D. \\(P(A,D) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\), \\(\\therefore A \\perp B\\). Events A and D are independent. 3.3 Question 3 Now let \\(E\\) be the event that at least one 6 is thrown and \\(F\\) the event that two 6s are thrown. Calculate: (a) \\(P(F \\mid D)\\). \\[P(F \\mid D) = \\frac{P(F,D)}{P(D)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\] (b) \\(P(F \\mid E)\\). \\[P(F \\mid E) = \\frac{P(F,E)}{P(E)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1}{11}\\] "],["exercise-4.html", "Week 4 Exercise 4 4.1 Question 1 4.2 Question 2 4.3 Question 3", " Week 4 Exercise 4 4.1 Question 1 \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) are mutually exclusive, exhaustive events such that \\(P(B_1) = 0.05\\). \\(A\\) is an event such that \\(P(A \\mid B_1) = 0.75\\) and \\(P(A \\mid B_2) = 0.50\\).

Of people with high blood pressure, 75% drink alcohol whereas only 50% of people without high blood pressure drink alcohol. What percentage of drinkers of alcohol have high blood pressure? Let event \\(B_1\\) represent people having high blood pressure in the population, whereas event \\(B_2\\) represents people without high blood pressure in this population. \\[\\therefore P(B_1) = 0.05, \\ P(B_2) = 0.95.\\] Let event \\(A\\) represent people who drink alcohol.

Suppose, in addition, that \\(P(A \\mid B) &lt; P(A)\\). Using Bayes’ Theorem, or otherwise, show that \\(P(B \\mid A) &lt; P(B\\). Interpret this result using words. \\(\\require{cancel}\\) \\[P(A \\mid B) &lt; P(A)\\] \\[\\frac{P(B \\mid A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} &lt; P(B)\\] \\[\\because P(A) &gt; 0, P(B) &gt; 0\\] \\[\\therefore \\frac{P(B \\mid A) \\cdot \\cancel{P(B)} \\cdot \\cancel{P(A)}}{\\cancel{P(B)} \\cdot \\cancel{P(A)}} &lt; \\frac{\\cancel{P(A)} \\cdot P(B)}{\\cancel{P(A)}}\\] \\[\\therefore P(B \\mid A) &lt; P(B)\\] Interpretation: the conditional probability will always be less than or at least equal to the total proabability of an event.
