These data result from a survey of 1000 people in the spring following the winter in question. Each person was asked whether they had no vaccine, 1 flu vaccine injection or 2 flu vaccine injections. Let \\(V\\) be a random variable equal to the number of flu injections that the person had. Let \\(F\\) be a random variable indicating whether the person did have flu (\\(F = 1\\)) or not (\\(F = 0\\)). 7.1 Contingency Table Table 7.1: Contingency Table with Expected Frequencies V = 0 V = 1 V = 2 Sum F = 1 24 (14.398) 9 (5.014) 13 (26.588) 46 F = 0 289 (298.602) 100 (103.986) 565 (551.412) 954 Sum 313 109 578 1000 7.2 Expected Frequencies Estimate the expected frequencies under the assumption that \\(V\\) and \\(F\\) are independent.

Justify your answer. Method 1: We can check the association by conducting a Chi-Square Test of Independence. Null hypothesis \\(H_0\\): There is no association between the number of flu injections and catching the flu. If the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true, and all the \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}\\) are large enough (\\(\\hat{\\mu}_{ij} \\geq 5\\) for all i, j), then \\(X \\mathrel{\\dot\\sim} \\chi_{2}^{2}\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} \\chi_{2}^{2} &amp;= \\Sigma_{i.j} \\frac{(n_{ij} - \\hat{\\mu}_{ij})^2}{\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(24 - 14.4)^2}{14.40} + \\frac{(9 - 5.01)^2}{5.01} + \\frac{(13-26.59)^2}{26.59} + \\frac{(289 - 298.60)^2}{298.60} + \\frac{(100 - 103.99)^2}{103.99} + \\frac{(565 - 551.41)^2}{551.41} \\\\ &amp;= 17.32 \\end{aligned}\\] We can plot the Chi-Square Density function: By inspecting the plot, we find that \\(P(\\chi_{2}^{2} \\geq 17.32)\\) is extremely small. We can use R to confirm that \\(P(\\chi_{2}^{2} \\geq 17.32) = 0.000173 \\ll 0.005\\) (using pchisq(17.32, 2, lower.tail = F)). Therefore, since the p-value is within the given significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. On the other hand, we can conduct the Chi-Square Test using R directly: Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: data X-squared = 17.313, df = 2, p-value = 0.000174 Since the p-value calculated by R is \\(0.000174 \\ll 0.005\\), which is small enough to reject the null hypothesis, we can prove that there is an association between the number of flu injections and catching flu. Method 2: We can test the association by estimating the conditional probabilities. Table 7.4: Estimated Conditional Probabilities of the Number of Doses of Vaccines Injected Given Catching the Flu or Not \\(i = 0\\) \\(i = 1\\) \\(i = 2\\) \\(\\hat{P}(V = i \\mid F = 1)\\) 0.5217391 0.1956522 0.2826087 \\(\\hat{P}(V = i \\mid F = 0)\\) 0.3029350 0.1048218 0.5922432 \\[\\text{Odds Ratio of (V = 0)} = \\frac{0.5217}{1 - 0.5217} / \\frac{0.3029}{1 - 0.3029} = 2.510\\] \\[\\text{Odds Ratio of (V = 2)} = \\frac{0.2826}{1 - 0.2826} / \\frac{0.5922}{1 - 0.5922} = 0.2712\\] We can either compare the estimated conditional probabilities of the doses of vaccines injected given having flu or not presented in the table above, or compare the Odds Ratio at \\(V = 0\\) and \\(V = 2\\) calculated above. We can clearly see that a large proportion of people who caught flu did not inject the vaccine, while about \\(70\\%\\) of people who didn’t catch flu at least injected one dose of vaccine. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that there is a negative association between V and F. 7.6 Improvement uppose that each person in this survey made their own decision whether to have \\(0\\), \\(1\\), or \\(2\\) vaccine injections. Can you see a potential problem with this? What would be a better way to find out how effective is the vaccine at preventing flu? The data collected may be unreliable if anyone among the sampled population reported the wrong data. It would further leads to the inaccuracy of our test result of independence / association of these variables. A better way to conduct this research is that we randomly draw samples of the same size from people who haven’t injected the vaccine, people who have had 1 injection of the vaccine, and people who have had 2 injections of the vaccine based on their medical record. Then, conduct a survey among these three sampled groups of people and see if they have had flu or not. "]]
